# Canvas Project

1. Multiple objects
The user can create multiple ball objects, which are stored in an Array. Objects
can be changed by being removed, through being clicked on and having their color
changed, through moving by bouncing, or through having their size changed. Balls
change position relative to the amount of balls.
2. Changes dependent on events
Keyboard events: space to bounce, left/right to edit number of balls, up/down to
change the size of the balls <br>
Mouse events: clicking on a ball to set it as active, clicking off of balls to
make the changes universal
3. Re-drawing
Automatic requestAnimationFrame()
4. Object-oriented programming
The ball object is a class that is used frequently. Getters + setters used. Ball
objects are stored in an array.
5. Element of depth beyond tutorials + demonstrations
Usage of acceleration? Mouse + distance calculation? Arrays (pop, push, etc)?
